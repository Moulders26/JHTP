										<center><h2>THE MEMORIAL PROCESS<br /></h2></center>
									</header>
									<span class="image featured"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>Choosing and purchasing a memorial may seem a daunting task if you are unfamiliar with the process. You may find it helpful to spend some time reading the following so that you feel prepared:</p>
									<h4>1. Ground settlement</h4>
									<p>Local Authority run cemeteries usually assert that a memorial can be installed after 6 months to a year from the time of burial in order to allow for ground settle. We would usually recommend waiting one winter after burial so the ground can harden in the frost helping the settlement process.</p>
									<h4>2. Deciding on the stone type and shape</h4>
									<p>There are many different types of stone in a varying colours and finishes. We will be happy to advise on suitability and those which are best suited to you.
									<h4>3. Choosing the inscription and design elements</h4>
									<p>Local Authority cemeteries allow for a very broad range of designs, wording and motifs, however, it should be noted that churchyards impose relatively strict guidelines. As an overall guide, the wording should not be an expression of personal grief. At this point we can discuss any artworks and etchings that may be required.</p>
									<h4>4. Quotation/costs</h4>
									<p>At J.H & T.P Duncan, we are often asked in general terms how much a memorial will cost. Our memorials are bespoke and the final price can only be confirmed once the design and lettering has been confirmed. The price is based on stone type, size and amount of inscription.</p>
									<h4>5. Paying a deposit</h4>
									<p>Once you are ready to go ahead we will request a deposit from you.</p>
									<h4>6. Approving the design</h4>
									<p>We will create a design for your consideration which can be modified until it is exactly as you want it.</p>
									<h4>7. Applying for a permit from the Church or Local Authority</h4>
									<p>Local Authority run cemeteries and Church churchyards will most likely charge a fee to make an application to install a memorial. Once you have approved the design layout, agreed the quotation and made deposit, we can submit the application to the appropriate authority. We will submit the application and pay the fee on your behalf.</p>
									<h4>8. Stone delivery</h4>
									<p>Timescales can vary somewhat regarding stone availability and delivery. Granite memorials are imported and can take anywhere from 12-16 weeks (normally we would expect a granite memorial to take 12 weeks to be delivered to us). We also hold some stone in stock which would makes the whole process much quicker.</p>
									<h4>9. Memorial installation</h4>
									<p>Once the stone is complete and ready to install we will normally request the remaining balance from the deposit. We are members of the British register of accredited memorial masons (BRAMM) and comply with their standards as laid out in the rules and regulations.</p>
									<h4>10. Completion</h4>
									<p>The memorial is now fixed ready for your viewing. The balance is requested before the memorial is fixed in the cemetery.</p>
