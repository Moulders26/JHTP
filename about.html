										<center><h2>Choosing a memorial:<br /></h2></center>
									</header>
									<p>When choosing a memorial, there are certain regulations which need to be considered. For cemeteries on the most part, all types of stone/granite are allowed, however the memorial will need to comply with the cemeteries regulations on size.</p>
									<p>For churchyard memorials, only stone which is sympathetic to the surroundings is permitted. The memorial would also need to comply with the churchyard authorities regulations on size, colour and material.</p>
									<p>As a memorial is a monument to a persons life, it is very important to choose the memorial carefully, with consideration paid to more than time and cost. Hasty decisions made in distress may result in later regrets, so it is sensible to wait and spend more time on selecting suitable designs for a memorial. You may also like to think about adding personal touches to your memorial, this could include a etched or blasted reminder of a favorite hobby or even a porcelain or etched portrait.</p>
									<p>All our etchings are completed by hand for a more personal touch.</p>

										<center><h2>Applying for a permit:<br /></h2></center>
									</header>
									<p>Memorials may not be erected in any cemetery without applying first for permission from the necessary authority. We would then make the application for you on your behalf as part of our service. We must ensure however that the signature obtained is that of the registered owner only otherwise the permit will be returned unapproved which may delay the final completion date of the memorial.</p>

									</header>
									<p>The responsibility and maintenance of your memorial is yours and not the stone masons or cemeteries management. Should it become unsafe, certain steps may be taken to lay it down or remove it. You can enquire us about any advise you may need and we can help ensure the best solutions. We also offer cleaning and repair services.</p>
